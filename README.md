# Features

# Liveblocks

Liveblocks is the service I used for the real-time collab stuff.

It's super neat, I love how it lets me be the one deciding how to authenticate.

Rather than being a complete package right away, it gives you the lego blocks for building collaborative web apps, including Browser Dev Tools for an awesome developer experience.

Another fun thing: It uses Cloudflare Durable objects [under the hood](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/websocket-infrastructure). The web socket servers sit on the edge.
